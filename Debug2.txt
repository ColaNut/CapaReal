Start from revising ADstrbtn_Directed.m, line 84 (from ExecIntrplt dominant to another version) --done
The hat_x in XZ plane is not actually zero, but summing to be zero: might resulted from: Wrong H calculation?
The wrong magnitude might resulted from (1) the above mention reason or the (2) implementation of B_k.
Test for longer w_y.

Check the mathematical theory in B_k.

1. check the MiddleVertex in KEV and KVE --done
2. Check the result of M_3 -> check the E2V transform

2. Think of the border(boundary conditions funciton, including fillLine1.m, etc. ).
Revise get_vIdx.m - done
Update all the m file 
Check get27Pnts_Kev.m
Go to Kev directly to check the real value
Go to Gvv directly to check the real value -done
Check Gvv, (Kev, K_1, Kve) for the feeding index.
Check Gvv for the missed middle point filled-in. - done
Check the Index in 

3. The hat_n direction in WmJ.m -done

4. Try the matrices multiplication for the 1-st edge on. 

4. Debug for the Grid shift table.


5. Test for GVV with Tol = 0.1.
