# CapaReal
3-d case with shifted grid

10/05: Grid shift in 2d.
10/06: Full 2d map.
10/10: Grid shift in 3d.

11/05: The runnint time to plot Phi and SAR for XZ, YZ and ZY 
are 161 (s), 64 (s) and 91 (s), respectively. 

11/09: The runnint time to plot real case Phi and SAR for XZ, YZ and ZY 
are 346 (s), 184 (s) and 807 (s), respectively.

The cal48TtrVol.m was cal8TtrVol.m not used. 

01/03: The electrode parameters are stored in UpElectrode.m, DwnElectrode.m, plotMap.m and plotYZ.m.

01/15: Need to build up the table to check SegMed: the two adjacent face (tetrahedran) should has the same medium value.
